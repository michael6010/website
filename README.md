# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of 
a course intended to teach students how to use GitHub for their own  
projects and also learn how to use GitHub for team projects. This means 
they'll be able to use Git to track changes in their projects, back up data, 
share your work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other 
users of Git.
A good place to start is "Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous" by Michael Hartl.
